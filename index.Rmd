# Mixture Modeling with `MplusAutomation` {.unnumbered}

<img src="images/immerse_hex.png" class="cover" width="250" height="193"/> Welcome! This will be a collection of resources that will teach you how to apply mixture modeling using Mplus[@muthen2017] and `MplusAutomation`[@hallquist2018]! These resources will serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding and applying LCA using Mplus and its automation capabilities with `MplusAutomation`. Here, you will learn from start to finish how to apply mixture modeling using Mplus with the `MplusAutomation` package.
