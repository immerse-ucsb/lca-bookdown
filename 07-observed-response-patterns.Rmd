Example: Bullying in Schools

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To demonstrate mixture modeling in the training program and online resource components of the IES grant we utilize the *Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)*[@usdoe2014] data repository.
The CRDC is a federally mandated school-level data collection effort that occurs every other year.
This public data is currently available for selected latent class indicators across 4 years (2011, 2013, 2015, 2017) and all US states.
In this example, we use the Arizona state sample.
We utilize six focal indicators which constitute the latent class model in our example; three variables which report on harassment/bullying in schools based on disability, race, or sex, and three variables on full-time equivalent school staff hires (counselor, psychologist, law enforcement).
This data source also includes covariates on a variety of subjects and distal outcomes reported in 2018 such as math/reading assessments and graduation rates.

## Variable Description

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tribble(
   ~"Name",      ~"Label",  ~"Values",                                   
#--------------|--------------------------------|-----|,
  "leaid",   "District Identification Code", "",
  "ncessch",   "School Identification Code", "",
  "report_dis",   "Number of students harassed or bullied on the basis of disability",  "0 = No reported incidents, 1 = At least one reported incident",
  "report_race",  "Number of students harassed or bullied on the basis of race, color, or national origin",  "0 = No reported incidents, 1 = At least one reported incident",
  "report_sex", "Number of students harassed or bullied on the basis of sex",  "0 = No reported incidents, 1 = At least one reported incident",
  "counselors_fte", "Number of full time equivalent counselors hired as school staff",  "0 = No staff present, 1 = At least one staff present",  
  "psych_fte", "Number of full time equivalent psychologists hired as school staff",  "0 = No staff present, 1 = At least one staff present",
  "law_fte", "Number of full time equivalent law enforcement officers hired as school staff",  "0 = No staff present, 1 = At least one staff present") %>% 
gt() %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "LCA indicators"  # Add a title
    ) %>%
  tab_options(
    table.width = pct(75)
  ) %>%
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)",
    location = cells_title()) 
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Variables have been transformed to be dichotomous indicators using the following coding strategy**

Harassment and bullying count variables are recoded `1` if the school reported at least one incident of harassment (`0` indicates no reported incidents).
On the original scale reported by the CDRC staff variables for full time equivalent employees (FTE) are represented as `1` and part time employees are represented by values between `1` and `0`.
Schools with greater than one staff of the designated type are represented by values greater than 1.
All values greater than zero were recorded as `1s` (e.g., `.5`, `1`,`3`) indicating that the school has a staff present on campus at least part time.
Schools with no staff of the designated type are indicated as `0` for the dichotomous variable.

    bully -> {report_dis report_race report_sex counselors_fte psych_fte law_fte}
 
 }") 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prepare Data

```{r, eval=TRUE}
df_bully <- read_csv(here("data", "crdc_lca_data.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  dplyr::select(report_dis, report_race, report_sex, counselors_fte, psych_fte, law_fte) 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Descriptive Statistics

Proportion of indicators using R:

```{r}
dframe <- df_bully %>%
  pivot_longer(
    c(report_dis, report_race, report_sex, counselors_fte, psych_fte, law_fte),
    names_to = "Variable"
  ) %>%
  group_by(Variable) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = sum(value == 1, na.rm = TRUE),
    Total = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>%
  mutate(`Proportion Endorsed` = round(Count / Total, 3)) %>%
  select(Variable, `Proportion Endorsed`, Count)

gt(dframe) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**LCA Indicator Endorsement**"),
    subtitle = md("&nbsp;")
  ) %>%
  tab_options(
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold",
    row_group.font.weight = "bold"
  )
```


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Observed Response Patterns

Continuining the example in this bookdown, save response frequencies for the 3-class model with `response is _____.dat` under `SAVEDATA.`

```{r, cache = TRUE}

patterns  <- mplusObject(
  
  TITLE = "C3 LCA - Save response patterns", 
  
  VARIABLE = 
  "categorical = report_dis-law_fte; 
   usevar =  report_dis-law_fte;
   classes = c(3);",
  
  ANALYSIS = 
   "estimator = mlr; 
    type = mixture;
    starts = 0;
    processors = 10;
    optseed = 802779;",
  
  SAVEDATA = 
   "File=savedata.dat;
    Save=cprob;
    
    ! Code to save response frequency data 
    
    response is resp_patterns.dat;",
  
  OUTPUT = "residual patterns tech11 tech14",
  
  usevariables = colnames(df_bully),
  rdata = df_bully)

patterns_fit <- mplusModeler(patterns,
                dataout=here("mplus", "bully.dat"),
                modelout=here("mplus", "patterns.inp") ,
                check=TRUE, run = TRUE, hashfilename = FALSE)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read in observed response pattern data and relabel the columns

```{r}
# Read in response frequency data that we just created:
patterns <- read_table(here("mplus", "resp_patterns.dat"),
                        col_names=FALSE, na = "*") 

# Extract the column names
names <- names(readModels(here("mplus", "patterns.out"))[['savedata']]) 

# Add the names back to the dataset
colnames(patterns) <- c("Frequency", names)  
```

Create a table with the top 5 unconditional response pattern, then top of conditional response pattern for each modal class assignment

```{r,eval=TRUE}
# Order responses by highest frequency
order_highest <- patterns %>% 
  arrange(desc(Frequency)) 

# Loop `patterns` data to list top 5 conditional response patterns for each class
loop_cond  <- lapply(1:max(patterns$C), function(k) {       
order_cond <- patterns %>%                    
  filter(C == k) %>%                    
  arrange(desc(Frequency)) %>%                
  head(5)                                     
  })                                          

# Convert loop into data frame
table_data <- as.data.frame(bind_rows(loop_cond))

# Combine unconditional and conditional responses patterns
response_patterns <-  rbind(order_highest[1:5,], table_data) 
```

Finally, use `{gt}` to make a nicely formatted table

```{r}
resp_table <- response_patterns %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(
    title = "Observed Response Patterns",
    subtitle = html("Response patterns, estimated frequencies, estimated posterior class probabilities and modal assignments")) %>% 
    tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("Data Source: **Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC)**")) %>%
    cols_label(
      Frequency = html("<i>f</i><sub>r</sub>"),
    REPORT_D = "Harrassment: Disability",
    REPORT_R = "Harrassment: Race",
    REPORT_S = "Harrassment: Sex",
    COUNSELO = "Staff: Counselor",
    PSYCH_FT = "Staff: Psychologist",
    LAW_FTE = "Staff: Law Enforcement",
    CPROB1 = html("P<sub><i>k</i></sub>=1"),
    CPROB2 = html("P<sub><i>k</i></sub>=2"),
    CPROB3 = html("P<sub><i>k</i></sub>=3"),
    C = md("*k*")) %>% 
  tab_row_group(
    label = "Unconditional response patterns",
    rows = 1:5) %>%
  tab_row_group(
    label = md("*k* = 1 Conditional response patterns"),
    rows = 6:10) %>% #EDIT THESE VALUES BASED ON THE LAST COLUMN
  tab_row_group(
    label = md("*k* = 2 Conditional response patterns"),
    rows = 11:15)  %>% #EDIT THESE VALUES BASED ON THE LAST COLUMN
  tab_row_group(
    label = md("*k* = 3 Conditional response patterns"),
    rows = 16:20)  %>% #EDIT THESE VALUES BASED ON THE LAST COLUMN  
    row_group_order(
      groups = c("Unconditional response patterns",
                 md("*k* = 1 Conditional response patterns"),
                 md("*k* = 2 Conditional response patterns"),
                 md("*k* = 3 Conditional response patterns"))) %>% 
    tab_footnote(
    footnote = html(
      "<i>Note.</i> <i>f</i><sub>r</sub> = response pattern frequency; P<sub><i>k</i></sub> = posterior class probabilities"
    )
  ) %>% 
  cols_align(align = "center") %>% 
  opt_align_table_header(align = "left") %>% 
  gt::tab_options(table.font.names = "Times New Roman")

resp_table
```
